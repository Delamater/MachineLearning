      <td>Company upgraded to windows 10. Used to run an ERP program which no one heard about, made by U8Soft (keep in mind that the company is in China). They are now asking for an insanely high amount of money to get it to work on windows 10.\nI tried installing it on windows 10 but you can't select the server. There's a drop down menu and almost all servers/devices on the network are listed except the one I need/want. It works fine on windows 7, compatibility mode doesn't help.FetLife\nMy question would be - since we're actually a small enterprise - are there any solutions for this problem? I'm looking to spend as little money as possible, or, ideally, none.https://discord.software/</td>

Will its contents be replicated in V12 patch 19 soon after?\n\nWe have two customers which use MRP heavily with subcontracting.There are new planning bugs introduced in version 12 patch 13: the calculed start and end dates are incorrect due to QC lead times. We are waiting for the fixes impatiently. They seem to be adressed in V11 patch 14.\n\nAs a side note, we are looking forward to a tool as awesome as the patch finder for V12!\n\nThank you.</td>

      <td>So I have this table that has only one index.  That index has four fields (composite key).  From what I've read on the sage knowledgebase, the first index defined inside a table is THE Primary Key.  However, Somehow I am able to write data to this table, with duplicate keys.  I understand databases and primary keys.  What I don't understand is how Sage is actually dealing with them.  \n\nHow do I get primary keys to work?  Or is there even a way to define a primary key on a table? I tested this on another server. At first it was promising, the primary key prevented duplicates. I wanted to test if the index defined on the table actually did anything so I changed it, and sure enough I was able to add records that I couldn't before (because before, they violated the primary key).  When I tried to change the Primary Key back to its original form I even got a beautiful message telling me there were duplicate records. So i deleted those records and was able to change the primary key to its original state. However, now I'm getting duplicate records violating the key! \nWhat's going on? I'm not observing any consistent behavior. If you change the index to a table, is a table validation not enough? What else do you have to do?\n\nBecause at this point I'm about to write code that will validate the key before writing to the table. Which is not good practice but apparently the constraints configured aren't functioning properly.\n</td>

      <td>Hello members,\n \nI'm looking for help on a sequence number formula that would help my customer create his lot numbers based on the expiration date or lead time.\nWe have the following to base the solution on:\n\nProduct code: ABC123:\n\nExpiration lead time : 270 days,\nLot managed,\nManufactured product,\n\n\nExpiration date format: MMMDDYY with MMM being month in alpha characters (November = NOV).\nThe lot number is created upon work order creation. My parameter values point to that effect.\n(EDIT) Other products may have different lead times; 180, 270 or 365 days. The formula needs flaxibility.\n\nThe lot number sequence structure is set up as followed:\n\nComponent type = MONTH; Length = 3\nComponent type = DAY; Length = 2\nComponent type = YEAR; Length = 2\nComponent type = CONSTANT; Length = 1; Formula = - “hyphen”\nComponent type = SEQUENCE NUMBER; Length = 3\n\nIf I use this structure, the lot number will be created based on the current date. For exemple October 30th 2019 will give OCT3019-001.\nHowever, my customer’s wants the lot number to represent the actual expiration date. Based on the product information above, for a product manufactured on October 30th 2019 + 270 days lead time, the lot number should be: JUL2620-001.\nWhat formula should I use to make this magic happen?\nThank you for your help, as always!</td>

Also added the below code in our project. \nNow we are getting the same error while we are trying to run the JAR from Sage X3, but it is running without any error when trying to run externally or directly from Java. We tried upgrading the Java Bridge server to version in Sage X3 upgraded to the latest Java Bridge patch of version 11. Current Java Bridge version is JAV_V1.223.1.0(17J)\n We followed below steps to call the 3rd party webservice from Sage X3:\n1)Add JAVAAPI.jar file to the eclipse workspace, whereas the Client provided us with JAVAAPI.jar to integrate with the merchant gateway of the third party site and inherited function to include in our JAR file.\n2)Placed the Build JAR file on the Java bridge server.JAV_V1.223.1.0(17J)\n3)After the successful connection, we are getting the below error after calling during triggering the function to add details on the Merchant website from our code. But same code is getting executed independently directly  through Eclipse without handshake error.\n\n Have anyone got this issue before, please let us know what could be the solution.</td>

This deposit must be non-taxable (although the price of the bottled product itself will be taxable).  it must also be multiplied on the SOH by the ordered qty.   Example :   Product XYZ has a unit price of 10.00 + tx.  The bottling surcharge is .10 cents.\nIf a customer in a certain sprovince where the bottling deposit is applicable orders 2 of these bottles, the amount exc. tax would be 20.20$.  The total amount would be :  (20.00$ + tx) +0.20$\nDue to the fact that this requirement is product and region specific, i was trying to set it up using the 'deposit" line within price structures, and creating a price list setup based on ITMREF AND SAT (subdivision which is our case is used as province). However, even though I have checkmarked that the surcharge should be "price/qty = yes" it is not multiplying the amount of the deposit (0.10$) by the ordered qty, nor is the deposit appearing in the total.\nHas anyone been using a different way to configure this type of deposit ?  I have seen someone post that they set it up as a tax, but i am not entirely positive it would hit the same accounts. \nPlease let me know what has worked for you</td>

      <td>Hi All,\nFor one of our customer we have written a sub program based web service in which we have used standard import export template to create the sales order in the system. The reason behind using the import export template is, we have sales kit product that needs to be exploded when item is selected. It was working fine, but in a particular scenario we are passing 8 different products and in the return XML we get all the 8 products in web service. But when we check the sales order in sales order entry screen it only shows 6 products. If we import it using the import export template under USAGE-&gt; Import export template, it imports all the 8 products however from the web service it is importing only 6 out of 8. If we pass these 8 products for another customer it import all the products. \nIt doesn’t return any error related to the other two products so we are not sure why it is not importing them. \nPlease let us know if there could be some setting related to this. \nRegards,Dinesh</td>

So after many attempts u decide to delete that payment and once u have delete it u find the invoice still paid but there is no payment recorded and can't even do any payment and matching it with the invoice as it will appear a note that invoice has already paid ..so kindly please if there is an solution for that type of invoices with provisional payment tell me what is it !</td>

      <td>I'm looking for some guidance and suggestions on best practices for custom data retrieval sets in landing pages.\nI have a fairly computation intensive View (GESAVW) that I've created that I want to layer into a landing page widget.  The context of the query is not really relevant to the discussion but here is a redacted screen shot of it for demonstration purposes.  This query will return results in SSMS in less than 3 seconds.\n \nMy first implementation of this was to implement the view in X3 then create a query based on that view in GESALH.  Then create a menu item of link type 'query' and add it to a landing page.  This works and retrieves the results very fast, but the grid isn't sortable or filterable, and i can't seem to find anyway in this implementation model to enable such features.  \n\nMy next implementation was to create a Class (GESACLA) model based on this View, then create a Representation (GESASW) of said class with the Filter P and Query facets enabled on each resultant field.  Then create a menu item of link type 'Representation' and embed it into a landing page.\n\nThis "works" sort of. The data is return with sorting and filtering enabled on the grid.\n\nThe issue is that same data set that runs in under 3 seconds directly on the DB takes upwards of 30 seconds to return in the Representation.  Additionally each attempt to sort and / or filter seems, on face at least, to require a return trip to the db to pull the results again.  Because of the lag its very easy to queue up several commands that cause the page to eventually lock and crash the session.  This is just with one user calling a single widget on one page so obviously this isn't workable as it is in a live deployment scenario.\nI guess my question is:\n- Is there a more efficient methodology in the Class / Representation model, setup and config-wise, to retrieve a view-based data set for sorting and filtering?\nor\n- Is there a way to ad sorting / filtering to a query-based object of that view?\nor\n- Is there an entirely different approach to the end result im not thinking of that would be a much better way of achieving the goal at hand?\n\nThank you,\nBen Turner</td>

I can't see an obvious solution to create a new invoice from the existing invoice as a draft/template. This seems very basic but not obvious.\nAny idea's?\nI can also live with downloading the csv, editting it and uploading it but again this is not obvious. \nAny help appreciated.\nRaj</td>

This code executes and I can use INFBOX to see that it is pulling the Sequence Number that I want. However, it does not use that number in the actual Work Order.

I have two servers that run Syracuse, one that has Mongo, and the other that's meant to stand alone as handling the web service traffic.\nAn issue I have is that each morning, there are all sorts of orders locked open by the web service connection. At that point I play a game of whack-a-mole going through the Locked Symbols function into User Monitor to close the connections. Sometimes closing one connection will release numerous locked orders.\nThe orders in question were imported via web services, but none of them are recent, they might be from a day or two ago.\nI've tried restarting the web service pool from each Syracuse server (if it makes a difference). I also restarted Agent Syracuse on the web service server. (That did clear up the connections, but only for a while.) I'm not sure what the best way to handle this is, or if I'm missing something relevant in the integration systems, for example some kind of 'dispose' method at the end of the import process.\nAny feedback on this topic would be great.

My knowledge of the system is rather limited but I do consider myself a very technical person. I've been tasked with a request to develop a Workflow that is sent off anytime a Receipt is created with a specific sublot. We use the sublot field to track our serialized components that are being shipped to us. A good bit of the documentation I've read so far has been mostly of approval signatures. I don't know really where to start outside of the workflow creation screen. I know that the event code should be ARP(Attached Reports), but again outside of those few bits on info, I'm lost. I'm familiar with the tables for the header and line data, I just don't know how to structure the actual work flow. X3 - V11</td>

Anyways it is far better to get paid in USD for the reasons I wont discuss here.\nMy main problem is this:\n3 employees were due to get transferred to USD on July 1st, however due to the technical error it was overlooked until 21st of July. The pay period closes on 25th for USD contracts and on the 1st of the following month for Manat contracts. Now while we are still in the same pay period technically we will be able to change it but because the specifics of their contract will change we would have to close their current contract, pay for the unused vacation and open new USD contract. Since their vacation days to be paid in Manats and at the same time as their USD new salary the system doesn't allow that.\n And now my question is how can we solve this situation because this doesn't make no sense.   Dear Sage community please help otherwise already underprivileged people will remain for another month and that one month of USD salary is the same as 3 months of  Manat salaries. \nThank you.</td>

      <td>Hi,\nI have a scenario that I am trying to manage using X3 and Customer Returns, and was looking for some advice, on the best way to handle it.\nI have a product that has been ordered, picked, delivered and invoiced as normal. 100 units of Product 'A'\ni now create a Customer Return, however 50 of Product 'A' are Ok, and 50 are 'Due for Investigation via QC' if they are being scrapped or returned to supplier.\nMy issue is, if I create the return with Credit Memo set to yes and I have only put 50 in the returned field on the return scrren, i get a credit note for 50, yes thats fine but is it a case of then creating another return for the remainder with Credit Memo set to No to effectivley get all the stock recorded and returned on the system.\nThe only way I can see at the moment is create the return with memo set to yes, receive all the stock in, then change the quantity on the credit note, leaving me to deal with the QC / Good Stock scenario etc with Bin to Bin movements.\nAny suggestions appreciated.\nThanks</td>

The scenario is as follows:\n\nThere are two companies A (distributor) B (manufacturer) configured in X3 V12\nCompany A subcontracts manufacturing from B, in the product we have a sub con BOM created\nIn Company a we have a location as Subcontracting and due to logistics all the stock required for sub contracting is transferred in Bulk to the sub con location.\n\nFor the most part this is working well, as Company A places a PO for stock and the intercompany automation creates a SO in BO with a B2B WO, all good.\n\nThe issue is that occasionally Company A will sell material that is in the subcontracting location, I understand that we need to bring the stock back to the internal location in A but because we are using a subcontracting location linked to a BP that is a site, you cannot do this using any of the standard flows like subcontracting transfers, returns, shipments etc. The only way seems to be a misc. issue and then receipt which is not ideal.\n\nAny ideas?</td>

      <td>I think I found a Sage bug.\nI had two accountants who got vague Stat99 errors when trying to run the Stock Accounting Interface in both V11 and V12. Users with identical functional profiles and roles did not get the same errors and could run the SAI without error. It was as though it was entirely user-specific. Finally, I determined the problem! There's a user parameter that is supposed to pop the simulated entries when the entries error out. This was causing the problem. To be clear, there were NOT any entries in the accounting interface with errors, but the fact that the user's parameter was set to Yes-If Error caused them to not be able to run the Stock Accounting Interface. Once I changed it to No, they could run it and post without error.\nThis parameter also caused problems with being about to post Sales Invoices in bulk or close a Fiscal Year.\nSo I am just offering this as a troubleshooting option for someone. Would love it someone else could confirm this in their own environment as well.\nHere is a link about this parameter (it's a really cool one!) https://www.greytrix.com/blogs/sagex3/2018/05/04/how-to-generate-simulated-accounting-entries-in-sage-x3-version-11/\n\nHere's the error it was generating: \n\nHere is what it looked like once I changed the parameter:\n</td>

This is also the reason that it is taking 30-45 seconds to generate one such report. We tried from two terminals, and two cores take the load.\nWe have checked SQL, VM Config, and found no problem.\nQuestion 1. Is this normal?

      <td>'Pac complete' as an overall function does not allow smaller units to break into larger units when needed for picking. Those smaller units need to be made manually available (or already available). Our orders need to be shipped in cases and pallets. Pallets are preferred when possible so we want to utilize 'Pac complete' function so that system is not directing our pickers to combine partial pallets together for shipment or picking from a partial and a full pallet to make 1 full pallet. The problem with the function currently is - when a customer orders on a case level (less then a pallet) the system will not allocate to the order if those case units have not already been made available because 'PAC complete' overrides the ability of a case to be picked from a pallet.\nWe do not want to constantly manually make units in order for this to work as it seems is currently the case. We also do not want to have to lock have our our stock in case units and the other half in pallet units.\nI've tried many different settings with the allocations rules and researched many different methods but cannot find a working solution.\nI believe if 'PAC complete' could be used on a line by line allocation/issue basis it would be a much more versatile system.\n</td>

The way FDMA works it doesnt see Q status stock (and as such doesnt plan around when it will pass test just around what would be worst case if we had to order again).\nWe're therefore looking at being able to put things on test without the status change... So that it in effect the lot goes on "hold" as it would if a count was being applied when a technical sheet is rasied..  Ie we can then see the stock as available in the FDMA calcualtion but cant allocate it to a WO without overdiding/completing the technical sheet.\nThankyou.

For example:\nAsset information:\n\n\n\n1st use date\n2020/10/09\n\n\nPurchase Price\n R                  25,000.00\n\n\nDuration years\n                                 4.00\n\n\nDepreciation p.y.\n R                     6,250.00\n\n\nDepreciation p.m.\n R                        520.83\n\n\n\nDepreciation calculation:\n\n\n\nMonth\n Start \nEnd\nDepreciation Value\nCumulative\n\n\nOct-20\n2020/10/09\n2020/10/31\n                            386.42\n                            386.42\n\n\nNov-20\n2020/11/01\n2020/11/30\n                            520.83\n                            907.26\n\n\nDec-20\n2020/12/01\n2020/12/31\n                            520.83\n                        1,428.09\n\n\nJan-21\n2021/01/01\n2021/01/31\n                            520.83\n                        1,948.92\n\n\nFeb-21\n2021/02/01\n2021/02/28\n                            520.83\n                        2,469.76\n\n\nMar-21\n2021/03/01\n2021/03/31\n                            520.83\n                        2,990.59\n\n\nApr-21\n2021/04/01\n2021/04/30\n                            520.83\n                        3,511.42\n\n\n\nYou will note that the 1st month's depreciation is calculated by:\n520.83 / 31 days * 23 days = 386.42 \nSimilarly, the last month's depreciation will be calculated as:\n520.83 / 31 days * 8 days = 134.41\nYet, the other month's depreciation is equal to 520.83 regardless of the number of days in that month.\nDoes anyone know how to set up this depreciation method? Can the system cater for a combination of pro-rata days &amp; months or must it be either or?\n\n</td>

If you have a company similar to ours, which I’ve detailed below, and are more than satisfied with your partner’s performance and willing to share who you’ve utilized, I would love to hear from you!\n Some background:\nWe are a nutraceutical supplement manufacturer that also uses 3rd parties for manufacturing processes at times. We procure many of the materials ourselves and generate our of BOMs and Production Orders in-house and may send to third parties who charge a tolling fee. We are following GMP guidelines and are FDA compliant, therefore QC is imperative. We need solid production planning and scheduling implemented as well as license plate barcoding in our warehouses. We will be operating with 3 separate divisions within the system and require a robust intercompany solution.\nWe are also interested in the potential of implementing certain features/modules slowly over time instead of all at once. This circumstance isn’t necessary for reaching out, but if it was something you did or were thinking of doing, I’d love to hear about that decision making as well.\nIf you are a partner, please do NOT reach out. I would like a first-hand response from satisfied users on a manufacturing partner that has met or exceeded the needs that my business requires.\nI greatly look forward to hearing from you and any recommendations you may have.</td>

When creating a new sales order in LIVE folder, it doesn't trigger the workflow because the "header condition was not met", and the APPFLG flag changed automatically from 1 (No) to 0 (blank), where it should be "5" (Yes, Automatic Signed).\n\nI duplicated the folder from LIVE to TEST folder (using Data Extraction and Data integration function), so all basis setup information is the same (i.e. workflow rules, parameters, server environment, assignment value, sales order information).\nWhen creating new sales order in TEST, though the header condition is not met, the APPFLG changed from 1 to 5(Yes, automatic). This is working fine.\n\nHere is the conditions for our workflow rule\n\nI activated the debug mode for both folder. \nBelow is the Debug log in LIVE folder.\nNotice that when creating new sales order , the default value for APPFLG is 1, but upon clicking "Create" it seems to have changed the APPFLG to 0 therefore it passed through the 3rd condition in the workflow rules. \n\nthe following is the debug log for TEST folder. The APPFLG was not changed. \n\n\nI have checked the specifics of SOH, it does not have codes relevant to APPFLG assignment.\nAnyway I duplicated the complete folder using Data integration, i presume any specifics should also be copied to the TEST folder.\nThis happens in X3 PU9 patch 3 (both folder has same patch).\nI checked also the TRT in both folders. some files are different.I tried to copy some related different files to TEST Folder but\n\nAny idea how to proceed troubleshooting / fixing this?\nYour valuable feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.</td>

As we run a 3 month cycle and have around 3600 work orders in place its a mammoth job to cancel and re-release these (lots of grouping and then routing changes to smooth demand/capacity).\nMy question is... is there a process to run to update all WO's with new routing/standard operaton data?\n\nCheers,\nJames</td>

      <td>I am trying to get an idea of best practices for bank accounts in X3.  We are coming from Sage 500 where there is a Cash Management module and implementing Sage X3, where there is not.  Our partner believes we should not make our cash account a control account due to having to set up BPs for each one (we have over 250). \nSince all of our cash accounts use the same g/l account, the way we would designate the bank account in a journal entry would be by using the journal code and that this would cause the journal line to be available for bank reconciliation purposes.  Since in every other ERP I have worked with, cash has been a control account I am having a hard time getting my head around this practice.\nAlso, using a specific journal code for each bank account would make it necessary to employ the use of a clearing account just to do a bank transfer entry (i.e., one journal to move funds out of bank account A offset with the clearing account and a second journal to move funds into bank account B offset with the clearing account).  In my experience, clearing accounts tend to be a reconciliation nightmare.  We have around fifty companies so that would be fifty more accounts to reconcile.\nI would be interested in hearing from companies that use BPs to handle their bank transactions with the Cash g/l account being a controlled account and also from those who don't have Cash set up as a controlled account and how they make their journal entries to allow bank reconciliation.  What are the pros and cons.\nThank you very much for whatever insights you can provide.\nCindy</td>

For the screen (CONSCPS2), I changed the Position number, and ran Validation.\n2. In the Inquiry screens function (for both "ALL" and "STD"), I changed the field's Order value to immediately follow "Receipt no.", and ran Validation for both.\n3.

And if that is the case, we might add a custom grid column for POHNUM, populate it ourselves, and move that column to the desired location.\nQUESTIONS:\nDoes anyone know why the above steps do not give us the desired result? \nHas anyone experienced this before?

      <td>Hello,\n\nWe are using Operating Budgets (Envelopes and Entities have been set up and is working fine)\n\nMy question is around multi-year budgets\nNormally if you have say a 3-year budget you need to enter a budgeted amount per year not breaking the ceiling(sum) of the envelope. We have an instance where the clients wants to only enter the budget on year 1 which is no problem as with closing the budgets the available balances will move to the next fiscal year etc\nThis is the issue we are facing:-\nThey want to close the Operational Budgets just after year-end to enable the available amounts to roll to the next (or then current) fiscal year so that consumption can take place on the new year. (Prior Fiscal Year will remain open)\nThe problem is that they receive Purchase Invoices very late after year-end. Is there a way to Close the Operating Budget but keep the portion of the open PO's available so as to process the PIH in the correct fiscal year (i.e. prior year)\nThank You</td>

      <td>Good morning, We are experiencing an issue where users are locking during creation of a document (quotation, order, invoice etc..). We have tested this across other areas of the system and we have the same problem. I report an example: We had 5 users in the process of creating quotation document. The first user is creating the quotation document without a problem, BUT it seems that this user still has a lock on the AVALNUM table in SQL Server. This means that all other users and all other areas in the system is locked out of the sequence number functionality in Sage. The system keeps spinning and does not assign a sequence number for our Quotation document as long as the first user does not close the Workflow Notification Box. They use the workflow regle to check and modify the message for the customer but if there is a delay to confirm of the message, we have this problem. It depend by filed [M:AWA3]INTERV of workflow regle....the transaction is active and the lock there are active until the user confirm the message. can this behavior be avoided or is there a standard workaround to avoid it?\nThank you in advanced</td>

      <td>I'm a relatively new user at StackOverflow, so my apologies if I violated any rules in my post.\nHere's some quick background to set the context for my question. I work as a quality analyst for a manufacturing company that stores all pertinent information about products, purchase orders, reject information, etc. in a database managed using Sage ERP X3 V6.5.\nI would like to create an app that will allow us to analyze reject information in a more powerful way than is currently available. Currently, we are forced to make database connections through the Sage ERP software. I am far more comfortable with Python and feel it is a more powerful way to explore this dataset.\nI am not extremely experienced in working with databases, so I have asked a higher up to setup a user with read-only access to our database through an ODBC connection. He has been fairly vague with his reasoning, but he seems to think it is not really possible to do this.\nThis leads me to my question: is it possible to create a user (through Sage ERP or some other medium) that has general read-only access to all of our databases? As I'm sure you can tell, I don't know a lot of the terminology for a question like this, so I'm happy to expand upon my post or answer any questions from people who respond to the best of my ability.\nmy account access</td>

This works fine for part of the products, but many are rejected with the error message\nField CCE : Analytical dimensions : 001PPINSC0 Record does not exist\nThe frustrating thing is that those dimensions that give errors all exist in X3 under the correct dimension type.

      <td>I'm a relatively new user at StackOverflow, so my apologies if I violated any rules in my post.\nHere's some quick background to set the context for my question. I work as a quality analyst for a manufacturing company that stores all pertinent information about products, purchase orders, reject information, etc. in a database managed using Sage ERP X3 V6.5.\nI would like to create an app that will allow us to analyze reject information in a more powerful way than is currently available. Currently, we are forced to make database connections through the Sage ERP software. I am far more comfortable with Python and feel it is a more powerful way to explore this dataset.\nI am not extremely experienced in working with databases, so I have asked a higher up to setup a user with read-only access to our database through an ODBC connection. He has been fairly vague with his reasoning, but he seems to think it is not really possible to do this.\nThis leads me to my question: is it possible to create a user (through Sage ERP or some other medium) that has general read-only access to all of our databases? As I'm sure you can tell, I don't know a lot of the terminology for a question like this, so I'm happy to expand upon my post or answer any questions from people who respond to the best of my ability.\nofficial website</td>

      <td>Ok X3 Tax experts.  This one is for you!  There are now several states that are beginning to charge Alcohol Volume Taxes.  The Tax determination rule function appears to be the perfect solution for the following:  ABV Tax = Volume * Rate.  In addition, the volume tax can have ranges.  Example:  ABV &gt;=14% is one tax, and, ABV &lt;=21% another.  The volume is calculated and is retained in (among others) SINVOICED fields DSPVOU  and DSPLINVOL.  The tax rate is managed in the tax rate function, as designed.  The challenge is when you are attempting to create a formula in the Tax Determination, the only table available is TAXLINK, and, the volume fields are not an option.   What is the table TAXLINK used for?  Other tables are not visibly an option.\nI'm open to suggestions, as the volume tax is one with many variables.  The Tax Determination function looks like the perfect solution, however, I can't figure this one out!  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\nTom</td>

      <td>Hi,\nMy first time posting something here, so I apologize if this is the wrong place for this.\nHere is the situation. We are using SEI version 8.2.7. When using the scheduler to email out reports, we have a report with multiple users, each with different restrictions. The restrictions filter the data correctly per user, however, when there is a user for which the restrictions result in no data, we’d like to suppress the email sent to them. There is a condition for not sending an email to any user, but not a condition per user level.\nBasically, a condition to not send an email if there is no data for a given user’s restrictions.\nI first contacted sage support on this (Sage Knowledge Base ID:101491), they advised I request this here as a feature request/improvement.\nhttps://support.na.sage.com/selfservice/viewdocument.do?noCount=true&amp;externalId=101491&amp;sliceId=1&amp;isLoadPublishedVer=&amp;docType=kc&amp;docTypeID=DT_Article&amp;stateId=15421&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;dialogID=628212&amp;ViewedDocsListHelper=com.kanisa.apps.common.BaseViewedDocsListHelperImpl&amp;openedFromSearchResults=true\nIdeally, I'd like the ability to toggle whether or not SEI sends a blank attachment or not (in some cases, even if the attachment is blank, the email may serve as a useful notification)\nHope I've properly explained this.\nThanks\nTauriq</td>
