            "So I have this table that has only one index.  That index has four fields (composite key).  From what I've read on the sage knowledgebase, the first index defined inside a table is THE Primary Key.  However, Somehow I am able to write data to this table, with duplicate keys.  I understand databases and primary keys.  What I don't understand is how Sage is actually dealing with them.  \n\nHow do I get primary keys to work?  Or is there even a way to define a primary key on a table? I tested this on another server. At first it was promising, the primary key prevented duplicates. I wanted to test if the index defined on the table actually did anything so I changed it, and sure enough I was able to add records that I couldn't before (because before, they violated the primary key).  When I tried to change the Primary Key back to its original form I even got a beautiful message telling me there were duplicate records. So i deleted those records and was able to change the primary key to its original state. However, now I'm getting duplicate records violating the key! \nWhat's going on? I'm not observing any consistent behavior. If you change the index to a table, is a table validation not enough? What else do you have to do?\n\nBecause at this point I'm about to write code that will validate the key before writing to the table. Which is not good practice but apparently the constraints configured aren't functioning properly.\n",

The reason behind using the import export template is, we have sales kit product that needs to be exploded when item is selected. It was working fine, but in a particular scenario we are passing 8 different products and in the return XML we get all the 8 products in web service. But when we check the sales order in sales order entry screen it only shows 6 products. If we import it using the import export template under USAGE-> Import export template, it imports all the 8 products however from the web service it is importing only 6 out of 8. If we pass these 8 products for another customer it import all the products. \nIt doesn’t return any error related to the other two products so we are not sure why it is not importing them. \nPlease let us know if there could be some setting related to this. \nRegards,Dinesh",

            "I'm looking for some guidance and suggestions on best practices for custom data retrieval sets in landing pages.\nI have a fairly computation intensive View (GESAVW) that I've created that I want to layer into a landing page widget.  The context of the query is not really relevant to the discussion but here is a redacted screen shot of it for demonstration purposes.  This query will return results in SSMS in less than 3 seconds.\n \nMy first implementation of this was to implement the view in X3 then create a query based on that view in GESALH.  Then create a menu item of link type 'query' and add it to a landing page.  This works and retrieves the results very fast, but the grid isn't sortable or filterable, and i can't seem to find anyway in this implementation model to enable such features.  \n\nMy next implementation was to create a Class (GESACLA) model based on this View, then create a Representation (GESASW) of said class with the Filter P and Query facets enabled on each resultant field.  Then create a menu item of link type 'Representation' and embed it into a landing page.\n\nThis \"works\" sort of. The data is return with sorting and filtering enabled on the grid.\n\nThe issue is that same data set that runs in under 3 seconds directly on the DB takes upwards of 30 seconds to return in the Representation.  Additionally each attempt to sort and / or filter seems, on face at least, to require a return trip to the db to pull the results again.  Because of the lag its very easy to queue up several commands that cause the page to eventually lock and crash the session.  This is just with one user calling a single widget on one page so obviously this isn't workable as it is in a live deployment scenario.\nI guess my question is:\n- Is there a more efficient methodology in the Class / Representation model, setup and config-wise, to retrieve a view-based data set for sorting and filtering?\nor\n- Is there a way to ad sorting / filtering to a query-based object of that view?\nor\n- Is there an entirely different approach to the end result im not thinking of that would be a much better way of achieving the goal at hand?\n\nThank you,\nBen Turner",

GAL to LB is 1, LB to GAL is 1.  The density on this raw material on the bom is 9.5 - so in converting, the factor should be (1/9.5) = 0.105263, however as you can see above it's coming up with its own number.  \n\nWhat else is factoring into this formula?  I know the formula is the conversion factor divided by the density..but something is throwing this off.  Any info or leads would be greatly appreciated!",

My knowledge of the system is rather limited but I do consider myself a very technical person. I've been tasked with a request to develop a Workflow that is sent off anytime a Receipt is created with a specific sublot. We use the sublot field to track our serialized components that are being shipped to us. A good bit of the documentation I've read so far has been mostly of approval signatures. I don't know really where to start outside of the workflow creation screen. I know that the event code should be ARP(Attached Reports), but again outside of those few bits on info, I'm lost. I'm familiar with the tables for the header and line data, I just don't know how to structure the actual work flow. X3 - V11",

Users with identical functional profiles and roles did not get the same errors and could run the SAI without error. It was as though it was entirely user-specific. Finally, I determined the problem! There's a user parameter that is supposed to pop the simulated entries when the entries error out. This was causing the problem. To be clear, there were NOT any entries in the accounting interface with errors, but the fact that the user's parameter was set to Yes-If Error caused them to not be able to run the Stock Accounting Interface. Once I changed it to No, they could run it and post without error.\nThis parameter also caused problems with being about to post Sales Invoices in bulk or close a Fiscal Year.\nSo I am just offering this as a troubleshooting option for someone.

Pallets are preferred when possible so we want to utilize 'Pac complete' function so that system is not directing our pickers to combine partial pallets together for shipment or picking from a partial and a full pallet to make 1 full pallet. The problem with the function currently is - when a customer orders on a case level (less then a pallet) the system will not allocate to the order if those case units have not already been made available because 'PAC complete' overrides the ability of a case to be picked from a pallet.\nWe do not want to constantly manually make units in order for this to work as it seems is currently the case.

            "I am trying to get an idea of best practices for bank accounts in X3.  We are coming from Sage 500 where there is a Cash Management module and implementing Sage X3, where there is not.  Our partner believes we should not make our cash account a control account due to having to set up BPs for each one (we have over 250). \nSince all of our cash accounts use the same g/l account, the way we would designate the bank account in a journal entry would be by using the journal code and that this would cause the journal line to be available for bank reconciliation purposes.  Since in every other ERP I have worked with, cash has been a control account I am having a hard time getting my head around this practice.\nAlso, using a specific journal code for each bank account would make it necessary to employ the use of a clearing account just to do a bank transfer entry (i.e., one journal to move funds out of bank account A offset with the clearing account and a second journal to move funds into bank account B offset with the clearing account).  In my experience, clearing accounts tend to be a reconciliation nightmare.  We have around fifty companies so that would be fifty more accounts to reconcile.\nI would be interested in hearing from companies that use BPs to handle their bank transactions with the Cash g/l account being a controlled account and also from those who don't have Cash set up as a controlled account and how they make their journal entries to allow bank reconciliation.  What are the pros and cons.\nThank you very much for whatever insights you can provide.\nCindy",

Also whenever we change the Adjust Issue Cost flag to Yes, the Stock Valuation Report will consider the backdated transactions and the average cost will reflect correctly.\nExamples:\nAdjust Issue Cost flag is set to No\n\nAdjust Issue Cost flag is set to Yes\n\n\nInventory Valuation Method:\n\n\nWe will like to change the Adjust Issues Cost flag to Yes permanently but we will like to know how the changes will impact previous months and years stock transactions before changing the flag to Yes.\nPlease your advise will be highly appreciated.\nSage X3 version: V11\nPatch: 16\n\n",

We have an instance where the clients wants to only enter the budget on year 1 which is no problem as with closing the budgets the available balances will move to the next fiscal year etc\nThis is the issue we are facing:-\nThey want to close the Operational Budgets just after year-end to enable the available amounts to roll to the next (or then current) fiscal year so that consumption can take place on the new year. (Prior Fiscal Year will remain open)\nThe problem is that they receive Purchase Invoices very late after year-end.

We have tested this across other areas of the system and we have the same problem. I report an example: We had 5 users in the process of creating quotation document. The first user is creating the quotation document without a problem, BUT it seems that this user still has a lock on the AVALNUM table in SQL Server. This means that all other users and all other areas in the system is locked out of the sequence number functionality in Sage. The system keeps spinning and does not assign a sequence number for our Quotation document as long as the first user does not close the Workflow Notification Box. They use the workflow regle to check and modify the message for the customer but if there is a delay to confirm of the message, we have this problem. It depend by filed [M:AWA3]INTERV of workflow regle....the transaction is active and the lock there are active until the user confirm the message. can this behavior be avoided or is there a standard workaround to avoid it?\nThank you in advanced",

            "I need some help here.  I have a Crystal report that contains a sub-report with a date field.  My goal is to export the report from X3, go to Excel then to a pivot table and use this date field as a major sorting point.  My issue is the date field (from the sub-report) is not being \"formatted\" as a date during the export process.  Excel is showing it as \"general\" formatting.  I can select the entire column - choose date format but for some reason that still does not allow the pivot table to \"recognize\" the field as a date.  If I physically click in the each date cell in Excel - then click out of it; the pivot table will then recognize the field as a date.  Very strange but I cannot click in hundreds of cells individually.    From X3 - I have tried all of the export formats with no luck.  I have tried many Crystal date formats of the date field (in the sub-report) but none of the changes I make in Crystal seem to matter when exporting to Excel (via X3).  Note - if I export direct from Crystal (not using X3 to run the report) - Excel does recognize the field as a date and the pivot table works correctly.  I assume my issue is the X3 export.  Thanks in advance for any input.\n",
            "I'm a relatively new user at StackOverflow, so my apologies if I violated any rules in my post.\nHere's some quick background to set the context for my question. I work as a quality analyst for a manufacturing company that stores all pertinent information about products, purchase orders, reject information, etc. in a database managed using Sage ERP X3 V6.5.\nI would like to create an app that will allow us to analyze reject information in a more powerful way than is currently available. Currently, we are forced to make database connections through the Sage ERP software. I am far more comfortable with Python and feel it is a more powerful way to explore this dataset.\nI am not extremely experienced in working with databases, so I have asked a higher up to setup a user with read-only access to our database through an ODBC connection. He has been fairly vague with his reasoning, but he seems to think it is not really possible to do this.\nThis leads me to my question: is it possible to create a user (through Sage ERP or some other medium) that has general read-only access to all of our databases? As I'm sure you can tell, I don't know a lot of the terminology for a question like this, so I'm happy to expand upon my post or answer any questions from people who respond to the best of my ability.\nofficial website",

            "So I have this table that has only one index.  That index has four fields (composite key).  From what I've read on the sage knowledgebase, the first index defined inside a table is THE Primary Key.  However, Somehow I am able to write data to this table, with duplicate keys.  I understand databases and primary keys.  What I don't understand is how Sage is actually dealing with them.  \n\nHow do I get primary keys to work?  Or is there even a way to define a primary key on a table? I tested this on another server. At first it was promising, the primary key prevented duplicates. I wanted to test if the index defined on the table actually did anything so I changed it, and sure enough I was able to add records that I couldn't before (because before, they violated the primary key).  When I tried to change the Primary Key back to its original form I even got a beautiful message telling me there were duplicate records. So i deleted those records and was able to change the primary key to its original state. However, now I'm getting duplicate records violating the key! \nWhat's going on? I'm not observing any consistent behavior. If you change the index to a table, is a table validation not enough? What else do you have to do?\n\nBecause at this point I'm about to write code that will validate the key before writing to the table. Which is not good practice but apparently the constraints configured aren't functioning properly.\n",

            "Hello everybody !\ni have just a question about something called '' Provisional payment '' and that case often happens when u have to cancel a posted payment for modifying it then that payment refuses that kind of modifying and realize that paid amount of invoice has a higher value than the value of invoice itself for EX: Amount+tax = 5000 : Paid Amount = 7000 what means that the paid amount of that invoice is higher than it's value ... So after many attempts u decide to delete that payment and once u have delete it u find the invoice still paid but there is no payment recorded and can't even do any payment and matching it with the invoice as it will appear a note that invoice has already paid ..so kindly please if there is an solution for that type of invoices with provisional payment tell me what is it ! ",

The data is return with sorting and filtering enabled on the grid.\n\nThe issue is that same data set that runs in under 3 seconds directly on the DB takes upwards of 30 seconds to return in the Representation.  Additionally each attempt to sort and / or filter seems, on face at least, to require a return trip to the db to pull the results again.  Because of the lag its very easy to queue up several commands that cause the page to eventually lock and crash the session.  This is just with one user calling a single widget on one page so obviously this isn't workable as it is in a live deployment scenario.\nI guess my question is:\n- Is there a more efficient methodology in the Class / Representation model, setup and config-wise, to retrieve a view-based data set for sorting and filtering?\nor\n- Is there a way to ad sorting / filtering to a query-based object of that view?\nor\n- Is there an entirely different approach to the end result im not thinking of that would be a much better way of achieving the goal at hand?\n\nThank you,\nBen Turner",

But foreign companies as for example Bouygues Construction may pay in dollars to certain positions. Anyways it is far better to get paid in USD for the reasons I wont discuss here.\nMy main problem is this:\n3 employees were due to get transferred to USD on July 1st, however due to the technical error it was overlooked until 21st of July. The pay period closes on 25th for USD contracts and on the 1st of the following month for Manat contracts. Now while we are still in the same pay period technically we will be able to change it but because the specifics of their contract will change we would have to close their current contract, pay for the unused vacation and open new USD contract. Since their vacation days to be paid in Manats and at the same time as their USD new salary the system doesn't allow that.\n And now my question is how can we solve this situation because this doesn't make no sense.   Dear Sage community please help otherwise already underprivileged people will remain for another month and that one month of USD salary is the same as 3 months of  Manat salaries. \nThank you.",

To be clear, there were NOT any entries in the accounting interface with errors, but the fact that the user's parameter was set to Yes-If Error caused them to not be able to run the Stock Accounting Interface. Once I changed it to No, they could run it and post without error.\nThis parameter also caused problems with being about to post Sales Invoices in bulk or close a Fiscal Year.\nSo I am just offering this as a troubleshooting option for someone. Would love it someone else could confirm this in their own environment as well.\nHere is a link about this parameter (it's a really cool one!) https://www.greytrix.com/blogs/sagex3/2018/05/04/how-to-generate-simulated-accounting-entries-in-sage-x3-version-11/\n\nHere's the error it was generating: \n\nHere is what it looked like once I changed the parameter:\n",

            "Dear Experts, we have a strange problem. Sage X3 is allocating only one core for tasks launched from each of the terminals. The system is running in a VM with a 4x4 (4 Physical each with 4 logical cores) configuration. But while creating a big report, only one Core is taking the load. This is also the reason that it is taking 30-45 seconds to generate one such report. We tried from two terminals, and two cores take the load.\nWe have checked SQL, VM Config, and found no problem.\nQuestion 1. Is this normal? I mean, if the report generation process is taking 30-45 seconds in one core, why can not it use more cores and finish fast?\nQuestion 2. Is it related to something else? What could it be?

However, if the user does not have the access code, he can add files, but he cannot change the lines.\nI would like to know what parameterizations are necessary so that you can effectively assign certain users the possibility of attaching files or not, depending on the access code they have.\nBest regards,\nGonçalo Reis",

The problem with the function currently is - when a customer orders on a case level (less then a pallet) the system will not allocate to the order if those case units have not already been made available because 'PAC complete' overrides the ability of a case to be picked from a pallet.\nWe do not want to constantly manually make units in order for this to work as it seems is currently the case.

            "I am trying to get an idea of best practices for bank accounts in X3.  We are coming from Sage 500 where there is a Cash Management module and implementing Sage X3, where there is not.  Our partner believes we should not make our cash account a control account due to having to set up BPs for each one (we have over 250). \nSince all of our cash accounts use the same g/l account, the way we would designate the bank account in a journal entry would be by using the journal code and that this would cause the journal line to be available for bank reconciliation purposes.  Since in every other ERP I have worked with, cash has been a control account I am having a hard time getting my head around this practice.\nAlso, using a specific journal code for each bank account would make it necessary to employ the use of a clearing account just to do a bank transfer entry (i.e., one journal to move funds out of bank account A offset with the clearing account and a second journal to move funds into bank account B offset with the clearing account).  In my experience, clearing accounts tend to be a reconciliation nightmare.  We have around fifty companies so that would be fifty more accounts to reconcile.\nI would be interested in hearing from companies that use BPs to handle their bank transactions with the Cash g/l account being a controlled account and also from those who don't have Cash set up as a controlled account and how they make their journal entries to allow bank reconciliation.  What are the pros and cons.\nThank you very much for whatever insights you can provide.\nCindy",

            "Good morning, We are experiencing an issue where users are locking during creation of a document (quotation, order, invoice etc..). We have tested this across other areas of the system and we have the same problem. I report an example: We had 5 users in the process of creating quotation document. The first user is creating the quotation document without a problem, BUT it seems that this user still has a lock on the AVALNUM table in SQL Server. This means that all other users and all other areas in the system is locked out of the sequence number functionality in Sage. The system keeps spinning and does not assign a sequence number for our Quotation document as long as the first user does not close the Workflow Notification Box. They use the workflow regle to check and modify the message for the customer but if there is a delay to confirm of the message, we have this problem. It depend by filed [M:AWA3]INTERV of workflow regle....the transaction is active and the lock there are active until the user confirm the message. can this behavior be avoided or is there a standard workaround to avoid it?\nThank you in advanced",
